    1] Current account A current account is a
    deposit account for traders, business owners,
    and entrepreneurs, who need to make and
    receive payments more often than others.

    no limit on the number of transactions per day.

    withdrawing more than what is currently
    available in the account. Also, unlike savings

    are zero-interest bearing accounts.You need to
    maintain a minimum balance to be able to
    operate current accounts.

    2] A savings bank account is a regular deposit
    account, where you earn a minimum rate of
    interest.
